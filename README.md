<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I demonstrate how to set up a practical Home Lab environment for learning Active Directory and fundamental Windows networking principles. The tutorial walks through installing and configuring Oracle VirtualBox to host virtual machines and building a Domain Controller using Windows Server 2019.

Key topics include configuring essential networking services such as IP Addressing, Routing/NAT, and DHCP. You’ll learn how to manually assign static IPs for internal network segments, configure the domain controller to act as a gateway for client internet access, and set up automated IP assignment for client machines.

The lab also features a PowerShell automation script that creates a thousand user accounts in Active Directory — showcasing real‑world administrative efficiency. Finally, you’ll deploy a Windows 10 client VM, join it to the newly created domain, and verify connectivity.

This guide is designed to be approachable and hands‑on, helping you build confidence in Active Directory and Windows networking without feeling overwhelmed.
